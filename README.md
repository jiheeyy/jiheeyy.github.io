### [Project 7](https://github.com/jiheeyy/jiheeyy.github.io/tree/main/project/7)
Using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, I deciphered a paragraph of substitution cipher text  "m it vbeh yjmbl. qbl lgb tfwlgo  ... ". Calculating the log score of each decryption based on popular bigram count in English (Google Corpus Data), I was able to identify the cipher text as a paragraph from chapter 12 of the novel All Quiet on the Western Front.

With similar methods, I also solved the knapsack problem (trying to pack a set of items, with given values and weights, into a knapsack with a maximum capacity), and I generated five or six-letter strings that sound like English names. This project references code presented in UChicago DATA 21300 (Models in Data Science).
